Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.

Beautiful:
1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand.
2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium.
3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.

Beast:
1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.
